The assessment focused on 95% of CCIB Exposure at Default across three scenarios based on the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS): \n1. Net Zero 2050\n2. Delayed Transition\n3. Current Policies\n\nAdditionally, three internal scenarios were included:\n- Base Case linked to current sovereign commitments\n- Two short-term 'tail risk scenarios' assessing Transition Risk from a green trade war and Physical Risk from climate change-induced migration\n\nThe scenarios also considered second-order impacts like food price inflation and decreased productivity. The severity aligns with the annual cyclical scenario driven by GDP shocks in key markets.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- The highest impact on Expected Credit Loss (ECL) by 2050 is in the Net Zero 2050 scenario.\n- Sectors like Oil and Gas, Construction, Transportation, and Utilities are most affected.\n- Short-term impacts are seen in Transportation, Automobiles, Construction, and Commercial Real Estate sectors.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Benign impact from physical risk due to nascent methodologies.\n- Static balance sheets and unchanged client business models.\n\n### Qualitative Review of Climate Risks\n\nIn 2023, Climate Risk was integrated into the annual business strategy and financial planning. The focus was on revenue reliance from high-emitting sectors and regions prone to physical risks. The Climate Risk impact is included in the Corporate Plan, with a 2024 plan to increase loan impairment due to climate risk.\n\n**Actions:**\n- Working with high-emitting sectors to prioritize sustainable finance.\n- Supporting clients with lower carbon intensity and clean technology.\n- Strengthening resilience towards a two-degrees Celsius transition.\n\n### Regulatory Landscape\n\nKey financial regulators have set expectations for climate and environmental risk management, aligned with Basel Committee principles. The organization is engaging with industry bodies to ensure consistency in policy across markets. A process is in place to track regulatory developments and obligations, with roles defined in the Group's Climate Risk Policy.",

    "md": "## Credit Quality Analysis (Audited)\n\n### Credit Quality by Client Segment\n\nFor Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking (CCIB), exposures are analyzed by credit grade (CG), which is crucial for assessing and monitoring risk. All loans are assigned a CG, reviewed periodically, and adjusted based on changes in borrower circumstances or behavior. CGs 1 to 12 are for stage 1 and stage 2 (performing) clients or accounts, while CGs 13 and 14 are for stage 3 (credit-impaired) clients. Consumer and Business Banking portfolios are analyzed by days past due, and Private Banking by the type of collateral held.\n\n### Mapping of Credit Quality\n\nThe Group uses the following internal risk mapping to determine credit quality for loans:\n\n| Credit Quality Description | Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking | Private Banking | Consumer & Business Banking |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| **Internal Grade Mapping** | **S&P External Ratings Equivalent** | **Regulatory PD Range (%)** | **Internal Ratings** | **Internal Grade Mapping** |\n| Strong                     | 1A to 5B                                      | AAA/AA+ to BBB-/BB+2 | 0 to 0.425 | Class I and Class IV | Current loans (no past dues nor impaired) |\n| Satisfactory               | 6A to 11C                                     | BB+/BB to B-/CCC+3 | 0.426 to 15.75 | Class II and Class III | Loans past due till 29 days |\n| Higher Risk                | Grade 12                                      | CCC+ to C4 | 15.751 to 99.9999 | Stressed Assets Group (SAG) managed | Past due loans 30 days and over till 90 days |\n\n### Notes\n\n1. For Private Banking, classes of risk represent the type of collateral held:\n   - Class I: Facilities with liquid collateral (e.g., cash, marketable securities).\n   - Class II: Unsecured/partially secured facilities and those with liquid collateral (e.g., equity in private enterprises).\n   - Class III: Facilities with residential or commercial real estate collateral.\n   - Class IV: Margin trading facilities.\n\n2. Banks' ratings: AAA/AA+ to BB+. Sovereigns' rating: AAA to BB+.\n3. Banks' rating: BB+ to B-/CCC+.\n4. Banks' rating: CCC+ to C. Sovereigns' rating: CCC+ to CCC to C.\n5. Medium enterprise clients within Business Banking are managed using the same internal credit grades as CCIB.\n\nThe table outlines gross loans and advances at amortized cost, expected credit loss provisions, and expected credit loss coverage by business segment and stage. Expected credit loss coverage represents the expected credit loss reported for each segment and stage as a proportion of the gross loan balance.\n\nFurther details can be found in the Summary of Performance in pages 235 and 236.",

The grading focuses on transition risk drivers due to limited physical risk data. Improvements in physical risk data coverage are noted, with plans to incorporate both physical and transition risk drivers in 2024.\n\n#### BRAG Ratings:\n- **Black**: High exposure to Transition Risk with little or no mitigation plans.\n- **Red**: Very high exposure to Transition Risk but with acceptable or good mitigation plans.\n- **Amber**: High exposure to Transition Risk but with acceptable or good mitigation plans.\n- **Green**: Low or limited exposure to Transition Risk.\n\n### Evaluating the Risk (Linkage to Credit Process)\n\nOnce assigned, climate risk gradings are integrated into the credit approval process. Risks not adequately represented in the credit rating may trigger additional monitoring and information requests.\n\n### Portfolio Management and Monitoring\n\n- **Concentration of Black and Red Clients**: Limited to 6% within key markets. Developed markets have more Green clients due to better climate risk disclosures.\n- **UAE**: Highest proportion of Red and Black clients due to fewer disclosures and high transition risk.\n- **2023 Initiatives**: Introduced climate considerations in underwriting for O&G, Mining, Shipping, and CRE sectors. Focus on reducing emission-intensive transactions and assessing risks to underlying collateral.\n\n### Strategic Focus\n\n- **Net Zero Climate Risk Working Forum**: Established to discuss high climate risk and net zero divergent clients.\n\n### Portfolio Distribution Across Key Markets\n\n- **Total**: 76.6% Green, 17.3% Amber, 5.4% Red, 0.7% Black\n- **Singapore**: 81.73% Green, 16.47% Amber, 1.52% Red, 0.28% Black\n- **India**: 73.8% Green, 21.1% Amber, 5.1% Red\n- **UK**: 56.1% Green, 39.1% Amber, 4.8% Red\n- **US**: 82.3% Green, 13.5% Amber, 4.2% Red\n- **UAE**: 74.4% Green, 16.1% Amber, 8.0% Red, 1.5% Black\n- **Hong Kong**: 84.8% Green, 11.9% Amber, 3.1% Red, 0.2% Black\n- **China**: 74.49% Green, 15.7% Amber, 4.65% Red, 3.89% Black",

These Operational and Technology RA metrics are consolidated regularly and reported at relevant Group committees. This provides senior management with the relevant information to inform their risk decisions."

Credit Impairment\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n### Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nThe Group's expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are complex and based on various assumptions.

Details are in the credit risk section under IFRS 9 Methodology.\n\n### Expected Credit Losses\n\nAn ECL represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the term of a financial asset, commitment, or guarantee.\n\n**Cash Shortfall:** The difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows.\n\n**Measurement:** ECLs are unbiased, probability-weighted amounts based on a range of outcomes, time value of money, and forward-looking information.\n\nFor material portfolios, expected cash shortfalls are determined by multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) and expected exposure at default (EAD). Multiple default events may occur over an asset's lifetime.\n\nForward-looking assumptions include GDP growth, interest rates, and commodity prices. These are based on the Group's forecasts and external information, consistent with budgeting and planning.\n\nTo address non-linearity in credit losses, multiple scenarios are considered. Scenarios are determined using a Monte Carlo approach based on macroeconomic forecasts.\n\nThe period for determining cash shortfalls is generally the maximum contractual period of credit risk exposure. For revolving credit facilities, the Group estimates an appropriate life based on credit risk exposure, including management actions like withdrawing facilities.\n\nFor credit-impaired instruments, expert credit judgement may be required.",

The hedging strategy involves using interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to manage variability in future cash flows. Hedge ineffectiveness is mainly driven by payment frequency mismatches. The hedged risk is determined by the variability of future cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest and/or foreign exchange rates.",
