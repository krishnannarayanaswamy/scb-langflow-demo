This document updates the 2021 White Paper, \"Net Zero Approach - Methodological White Paper,\" and is a crucial step in fulfilling the bank's net zero commitment and ensuring transparent information disclosure.\n\nThe 2024 White Paper outlines the methodology used to ensure accurate reporting of financed and facilitated emissions. This is vital for raising awareness and building trust with stakeholders. The bank aims to achieve net zero by 2050 by measuring, managing, and reducing emissions from its financing and facilitation activities. The approach is based on science and sector-agreed practices, focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive sectors. As a lender, Standard Chartered plays a key role in transitioning to net zero across its 53 markets.\n\n## Background\n\nSince the 2021 White Paper, Standard Chartered's net zero commitments have evolved, with enhanced metrics applied in several sectors:\n\n- **Oil and Gas (O&G):** The baseline and target have shifted from a revenue-based intensity to an absolute emissions metric, establishing an emissions budget for the sector.\n- **Power and Steel:** These sectors have moved from a revenue-based intensity to a physical intensity, measuring emissions relative to a production unit.\n- **Other Sectors:** Shipping, automotive, aluminium, cement, Commercial Real Estate (CRE), and residential mortgages are now included in a sector deep-dive, with reporting based on production or physical intensity.",

Decarbonizing this sector is crucial for achieving net zero emissions.\n\n### Regional Emissions\n\nOver half of the O&G sector's emissions come from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. These regions are significant for Standard Chartered's market footprint and related financing activities. The O&G sector contributes around 10 million tonnes of CO₂e per year to the bank's financed emissions.\n\n### Challenges and Transition\n\nThe transition away from fossil fuels is a major challenge due to their deep entrenchment in the global economy. This requires developing new technologies and business models to reduce production and alter consumption patterns. A rapid global scale-up of clean energy is necessary, ensuring a secure, equitable, and sustainable future.\n\n### Strategic Levers and Options\n\nThe document outlines strategies to decarbonize the O&G sector:\n\n#### Table 3: O&G Strategic Levers and Options\n\n- **Reduce O&G Production Emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2)**\n  - Improve operational efficiency of O&G production.\n  - Reduce methane leakages, venting, and flaring.\n  - Integrate renewables and low-emission electricity into upstream and LNG developments.\n  - Abate emissions at source using carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS, CCUS).\n\n- **Develop Non-Oil and Gas Businesses**\n  - Transition to non-fossil fuel energy businesses: low-emission electricity generation, synthetic fuels, advanced biofuel, power-to-x.\n  - Transition to non-energy businesses: electricity distribution, electric vehicle (EV) battery charging, energy efficiency, distributed battery/energy storage.\n\nThese strategies aim to address the energy trilemma and are regularly updated to reflect industry knowledge.",

It is the largest source of industrial CO₂ emissions, accounting for about 7% of global emissions. This is mainly due to the reliance on metallurgical coal for ironmaking in blast furnaces.\n\n#### Decarbonising Steel Production\n\nFour technological levers have been identified to reduce emissions in steel production:\n\n1. **Scrap-based Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)**\n2. **Natural Gas-based Direct Reduction Plant and EAF (NG-DRI EAF)**\n3. **Hydrogen Direct Reduction Plant and EAF (H-DRI EAF)**\n4. **Blast Furnaces with post-combustion Carbon Capture and Storage (BF-BOF-CCS)**\n\nThe implementation of these levers depends on local conditions and asset specifics. With global demand for steel expected to grow by 30% by 2050, decarbonising the sector presents both challenges and opportunities.\n\n#### Sustainable STEEL Principles (SSP)\n\nDeveloped by international banks and facilitated by the Centre for Climate-Aligned Finance at RMI, the SSP framework standardizes CO₂ reporting in the steel sector. Standard Chartered's commitment to the SSP includes:\n\n1. Annual measurement and reporting of climate-related alignment of the steel lending portfolio.\n2. Annual publication of portfolio climate alignment scores and narratives.\n3. Sourcing data from clients or approved third-party providers.\n4. Engaging with clients to maximize real economy impact by advancing emissions reductions.\n5. Setting steel portfolio targets informed by the SSP and updating as data evolves.\n\n#### Value Chain Boundary\n\nMost GHG emissions in the steel sector are related to production. Standard Chartered reports emissions using the 'Fixed System Boundary' from the SSP, covering all emissions from ironmaking and steelmaking on a best-efforts basis.",
